### DJS06 Project Brief: Higher Order Functions
### 
Overview
This project demonstrates basic and advanced JavaScript operations on an array of products. It includes logging product names, filtering products by name length, manipulating prices, concatenating product names, finding extremes in prices, and transforming product objects.

Prerequisites
To run the code in this project, you need a JavaScript runtime environment. You can use Node.js or a browser console.

Project Structure
The project consists of a single JavaScript file containing the following main operations:

Logging Product Names
Filtering Products by Name Length
Price Manipulation
Concatenating Product Names
Finding Extremes in Prices
Object Transformation

Run the code in a JavaScript runtime environment such as Node.js or a browser console.
Observe the console output to see the results of each operation.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive demonstration of JavaScript array operations, including iteration, filtering, mapping, reducing, and object transformation. It serves as a practical example for manipulating and analyzing data in JavaScript.
